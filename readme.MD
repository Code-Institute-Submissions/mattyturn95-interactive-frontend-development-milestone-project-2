The Trip Starter travel application uses the Google Maps and Places APIs to allow users to select a location and find places to visit, stay and dine. Users may then select their own custom itinerary to help coordinate a trip. They may then continue to edit this itinerary to help plan their perfect trip.

    ## UX

#### Project Goals

### User Goals

The desired target market/audience for this app is for tarvelers old or young looking at exploring the world and finding the perfect destination using the trip starter app.

user goals:
- to find the perfect destination and add it to the itinerary
- feel at ease with the selection made with the relevant options that appeared.

Trip Starter provides the neccesary functions to deliver the needs and wants of a traveller
- by adding relevant searches ie. restaurants and bars hotels and bnbs.
- It makes use of google maps to enable a sense of organised planning 

#### User Stories

My goal was to create a site that allows users to plan and document there travel itinerary inorder to achieve a unique and positive user experience.
As a user of the site I want to:
1. to select a destination and have a look at the relevent bars, hotels and tourist destinations.
2. create a list to keep my plans neat and tidy.

### Design Choices
I like the idea of a minimalist approach where by users can enter a site without feeling overwhelmed ny the extensive use of flashy colors and hard on the eye graphics. I want to create a clear and positive user experience.

**fonts**
- The Cinzel serif font was chosen to create a simple yet effective way of displaying text throughout the project
it has a clean easy to look at feel.

**icons**
- I made use of the large array of icons that font-awesome has to provide its a simple way of creating an effect to show what the site has to offer.
- i made use of the, Fork, Wine glass, Ship, Swimming pool & umbrella icons which i though was an effective way to show users that our site offers the relevent services.

**colors**
- Throughout the majority of my project i have made use of dark grey colors to give a sense of ease on the users eyes

**styling**
- I opted for a basic navbar with three links to ensure the user does not get lost with too many options to venture off from.
- The background Image is of an aerial view of a city night sky with an Opaque overlay to reduce the intensity of the sharp city lights, I felt that it gives off a feeling or relaxtaion and calmness to the user when landing upon the page.
- I have made use of the boostrap grid system to create a less complex approach to relaying my content with in the site.

**logo**
- I once again obtained the logo as a font-awesome icon to ensure simplicity.
- I chose an aeroplane as i felt it suited the needs of a travel app within the right context.
