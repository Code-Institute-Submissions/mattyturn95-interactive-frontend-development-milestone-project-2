The Trip Starter travel application uses the Google Maps and Places APIs to allow users to select a location and find places to visit, stay and dine. Users may then select their own custom itinerary to help coordinate a trip. They may then continue to edit this itinerary to help plan their perfect trip.

    ## UX

#### Project Goals

### User Goals

The desired target market/audience for this app is for tarvelers old or young looking at exploring the world and finding the perfect destination using the trip starter app.

user goals:
- to find the perfect destination and add it to the itinerary
- feel at ease with the selection made with the relevant options that appeared.

Trip Starter provides the neccesary functions to deliver the needs and wants of a traveller
- by adding relevant searches ie. restaurants and bars hotels and bnbs.
- It makes use of google maps to enable a sense of organised planning 

#### User Stories

My goal was to create a site that allows users to plan and document there travel itinerary inorder to achieve a unique and positive user experience.
As a user of the site I want to:
1. to select a destination and have a look at the relevent bars, hotels and tourist destinations.
2. create a list to keep my plans neat and tidy.

### Design Choices
I like the idea of a minimalist approach where by users can enter a site without feeling overwhelmed ny the extensive use of flashy colors and hard on the eye graphics. I want to create a clear and positive user experience.

**fonts**
- The Cinzel serif font was chosen to create a simple yet effective way of displaying text throughout the project
it has a clean easy to look at feel.

**icons**
- I made use of the large array of icons that font-awesome has to provide its a simple way of creating an effect to show what the site has to offer.
- i made use of the, Fork, Wine glass, Ship, Swimming pool & umbrella icons which i though was an effective way to show users that our site offers the relevent services.

**colors**
- Throughout the majority of my project i have made use of dark grey colors to give a sense of ease on the users eyes

**styling**
- I opted for a basic navbar with three links to ensure the user does not get lost with too many options to venture off from.
- The background Image is of an aerial view of a city night sky with an Opaque overlay to reduce the intensity of the sharp city lights, I felt that it gives off a feeling or relaxtaion and calmness to the user when landing upon the page.
- I have made use of the boostrap grid system to create a less complex approach to relaying my content with in the site.

**logo**
- I once again obtained the logo as a font-awesome icon to ensure simplicity.
- I chose an aeroplane as i felt it suited the needs of a travel app within the right context.

## Features
### Existing Features
-The app uses the Google Maps and Google Places API to provide search results about accommodation, places of interest and places to eat. Each individual result may be added to a list below the map so user's can keep track of the places they wish to visit, stay or dine.

### Features left to implement 
-In the future, I would like users to be able to save the pdf file and share it through social media to enable friends and family to have a look at the itinerary for future purposes.

### Testing
-## Automated Testing

### Validation services
The following validation services and linter were used to check the validity of the website code.
- [W3C Markup Validation]( https://validator.w3.org/) was used to validate HTML.
- [W3C CSS validation](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) was used to validate CSS.
- [JSHint](https://jshint.com/) was used to validate JavaScript.

## Manual testing
Below is a detailed account of all the manual testing that has been done to confirm all areas of the site work as expected. 

### Testing undertaken on desktop and laptop

All steps on desktop were repeated in browsers: Firefox, Chrome and Internet Explorer and on two different desktop screen sizes.

1. Responsiveness
    - The results table sits alongside the map on larger devices as PC and laptop. 

### Testing undertaken on tablet and phone devices
All steps below were repeated to test mobile specific elements on the developers 2 Samsung phones and tablet. 
And also in the Chrome Developer Tools device simulators on all options and orientations.

1. Responsiveness
    - The results table is hidden and appears directly under the map only when the user selects the visit, stay or dine buttons.

This site was tested across multiple browsers (Chrome, Safari, Internet Explorer, FireFox) in Google Dev tools(Galaxy S5, Pixel 2/Pixel 2 XL, iphone 5/SE/6/7/8 Plus, X, ipad and ipad Pro) and on multiple devices.

## Further Testing

Family and friends were asked to try the app on their devices. This insight was invaluable for improving site usability.
